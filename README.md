# zlux-app-server
This is the default setup of the Zowe App Server, built upon the zLUX framework. Within, you will find a collection of build, deploy, and run scripts as well as configuration files that will help you to configure a simple zLUX server with a few Apps included.

**To request features or report bugs, please use the issues page at the [zlux repo](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues) with the server infrastructure or server security tags**

## Introduction


### What is Zowe?
Zowe is an open source project created to host technologies that benefit the Z platform from all members of the Z community (Integrated Software Vendors, System Integrators and z/OS consumers). Zowe, like Mac OS or Windows, comes with a set of APIs and OS capabilities with a virtual web desktop that offers a modern interface to interact with z/OS in a way that is similar to what you experience on cloud platforms today. To find out more, visit the [Zowe website](https://www.zowe.org/).

### ZSS & zLUX App Server layout
The zLUX App Server consists of the Zowe Desktop, its Apps, and the authentication. The zLUX App Server backend is an extensible server, written using nodeJS and utilizes expressJS for routing. It handles the backend components of Apps and can also serve as a proxy for requests from Apps to additional servers. One such proxy destination is the ZSS - a Zowe backend component called **Zowe System Services**. It is a so-called agent for the App server. **NOTE: ZSS is optional, as having a mainframe is NOT a requirement for using the Zowe Desktop. That being said, many apps will not function as intended since they rely on an agent for data.**

The zLUX App Server and ZSS utilize the same deployment & App/Plugin structure, and share some configuration parameters as well. It is possible to run ZSS and zLUX App Server from the same system, in which case you would be running under z/OS USS. This configuration requires that IBM's version of nodeJS is installed and used. Another way to set up zLUX is to have the zLUX App Server running under LUW, while keeping ZSS under USS. This is the configuration scenario presented below. In this scenario, you'll need to clone these github repositories to two different systems, and they'll need to have compatible configurations. For first-timers, it is fine to have identical configuration files and `/plugins` folders in order to get going.

## First-time Installation & Use
Getting started with this server requires just a few steps:

0. [Install Prerequisites](#0-install-prerequisites)
1. [Acquire the source code](#1-acquire-the-source-code)
2. [Set the server configuration](#2-set-the-server-configuration)
3. [Build Apps](#3-build-zlux-apps)
4. [Deploy server configuration files](#4-deploy-server-configuration-files)
5. [Build ZSS](#5-build-zss)
6. [Run the server](#6-run-the-server)
7. [Connect in a browser!](#7-connect-to-the-zowe-desktop-via-a-browser)

So, with that in mind, follow each step and you'll be on your way to your first zLUX App Server instance!

### 0. Install Prerequisites
Wherever the App Server is installed, the following is required for running:

* **NodeJS** - v6.14.4 minimum for z/OS,  elsewhere 6, 8, and 10 work well.

* **npm** - v6.4 minimum

For building zLUX framework and apps:

* **jdk** - v8 minimum
 
* **ant** - v1.10 minimum

* **ant-contrib** - v1 minimum

For building zss:

* **IBM z/OS XLC compiler for Metal C Compilation**

For developent:

* **git** - 2.18 or higher is recommended off z/os

* **ssh agent** - Our repositories are structured to expect that you have ssh keys setup for github. This assists with rapid development and automation. 
Git bash or putty's pageant are some of various tools that can help you setup & work with ssh keys over git.

#### (Optional) Install git for z/OS
Because all of our code is on github, yet ZSS must run on z/OS and the zLUX App Server may optionally run on z/OS as well, having git on z/OS is the most convenient way to work with the source code. The alternative would be to utilize FTP or another method to transfer contents to z/OS.
If you'd like to go this route, you can find git for z/OS free of charge here: http://www.rocketsoftware.com/product-categories/mainframe/git-for-zos
On z/OS, git 2.14.4 is the minimum needed.


### 1. Acquire the source code

#### (Recommended) ZSS

To get started, first clone or download the code necessary to build ZSS and the ZSS cross memory server.
If using git, the following commands should be used on z/OS:
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:zowe/zss.git
```

#### Zowe Desktop

Afterwards, clone (or download) the github capstone repository, https://github.com/zowe/zlux
As we'll be configuring ZSS on z/OS's USS, and the zLUX App Server on a LUW host, you'll need to put the contents on both systems.
If using git, run the following commands:
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:zowe/zlux.git
cd zlux
git submodule foreach "git checkout master"
```

NOTE: For the most up-to-date features (but potentially less stable), use the 'staging' branch by instead doing
```
git submodule foreach "git checkout staging"
```

#### (Recommended) Authentication

By default the trivial authentication backend is enabled which always returns successful unless authentication 
information provided is in an incorrect format. To use ZSS as an authentication backend, clone (or download) the 
`zss-auth` plugin code into the `zlux` directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:zowe/zss-auth.git
```

#### (Recommended) Apps

To add Apps to the Zowe desktop, you need to clone, or download, them (currently available via Git repositories) into the `/zlux` folder. For 
example, clone (or download) the following to get sample apps source code:

```
git clone git@github.com:zowe/sample-angular-app.git
git clone git@github.com:zowe/sample-react-app.git
git clone git@github.com:zowe/sample-iframe-app.git
```

At this point, you'll have the latest code from each repository on your system.
Continue from within zlux-app-server.

### 2. Set the server configuration
Read the [Configuration](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/Configuration-for-zLUX-App-Server-&-ZSS) wiki page for a detailed explanation of the primary items that you'll want to configure for your first server.

In short, ensure that within **zlux-app-server/config/zluxserver.json**, **node.https.port + other HTTPS parameters** are set to your liking on the LUW host.

#### Setup for ZSS
If you will be using ZSS as an authentication backend, set `dataserviceAuthentication.defaultAuthentication = "zss"` and
 `dataserviceAuthentication.implementationDefaults.zss.plugins = ["org.zowe.zlux.auth.zss"]`.
 
Next, set **agent.http.port** to the port where you want ZSS to listen on. This must be done at minimum on the z/OS host, but can also be done in the zluxserver.json where the App server is running, if it is not the same.
Finally, if the App server is running off of z/OS, then you will need to change **agent.http.ipAddresses** to a hostname or ip address that is externally visible.
**Note: It is highly recommended to turn on HTTPS for ZSS via [configuring AT-TLS](https://zowe.github.io/docs-site/latest/user-guide/mvd-configuration.html#configuring-zss-for-https) when using ZSS externally, as the session security is essential for all but trivial development environments**

#### Setup for Apps

You can follow these steps or for a more detailed overview check out [this wiki](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/Installing-Plugins) on installing apps.

For each App that is supposed to be loaded by zLUX App server (used in the Zowe Desktop), a plugin JSON should be defined. For more details, check out the  
[Locating Plugins](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/Zlux-Plugin-Definition-&-Structure#locating-plugins) section in the wiki. For example, to enable Angular Sample App, create a
`zlux/zlux-app-server/plugins/org.zowe.zlux.sample.angular.json` with the following contents:
```
{
  "identifier": "org.zowe.zlux.sample.angular",
  "pluginLocation": "../../sample-angular-app"
}
```

#### Setup for TN3270/VT Terminal or other terminal apps

Before continuing, if you intend to use the terminal, the app may need to be pre-configured to know the destination host.
Edit `tn3270-ng2/_defaultTN3270.json` to set *host* and *port* to a valid TN3270 server telnet host and port and then save the file.
Edit `vt-ng2/_defaultVT.json` to set *host* and *port* to a valid ssh host and port and then save the file. 
For the TN3270 and VT Terminal apps, this file is set to use the default host when nothing is specified.

### 3. Build Apps
**Note when building, NPM is used. The version of NPM needed for the build to succeed should be at least 6.4. You can update NPM by executing `npm install -g npm`. The following provides steps on how to build all of Zowe. If you would like to build individual apps (or after your Zowe has already been built) you can follow the [instructions here](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/Building-Plugins)**

If you downloaded any Apps from the first step, you need to build them. zLUX Apps (Apps on the Zowe Desktop) may contain server (`/nodeServer`) and/or web (`/webClient`) components. The web components must be built, as webpack is involved in optimized packaging, and server components are also likely to need building if they require external dependencies from NPM, use native code, or are written in typescript. You can find more details for server and web [here](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/ZLUX-App-filesystem-structure)

This server only needs transpilation and packaging of web components, and therefore we do not need any special build steps for the host running ZSS.

Instead, on the host running the zLUX App Server, inside `zlux-build` run the script that will automatically build all packaged Apps:
```
//Windows
build.bat

//Otherwise
./build.sh
```

**NOTE: This may take some time to complete (<40 minutes), depending on which environment you are trying to use Zowe on. It has been reported that building can hang on Windows if you have put the code in a directory that has a symbolic link. **

### 4. Deploy server configuration files
If you are running the zLUX App Server seperate from ZSS, you must ensure the ZSS installation has its configuration deployed. You can accomplish this via:

```
// in zlux-build directory
ant deploy
```

On the other hand, if you are running ZSS and the zLUX App Server on the same host, *build.sh* and *build.bat* execute *deploy* and therefore this task was accomplished in step #4.

However, if you need to change the server configuration files or want to add more Apps to be included at startup, you'll need to update the deploy content to reflect this. Simply running deploy.bat or deploy.sh will accomplish this, but files such as zluxserver.json are only read at startup, so a reload of the zLUX App Server & ZSS would be required.

### 5. Build ZSS
If you downloaded ZSS from the first step and wish to use ZSS for authentication, you need to build it. ZSS is a dependency of zLUX, but exists in a seperate repository and must be run on z/OS. To get the code, go back to [here](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-app-server/tree/staging#1-acquire-the-source-code)

Go inside the `build` folder. Ant is used to build ZSS, and ZSS is built in two parts: the ZSS Server and the ZSS cross memory Server. ZSS Server communicates through HTTP(S) to zLUX, while the cross memory server is communicated with by ZSS through in-system calls.
To build both, run:
```
ant zss
ant zis
```

Afterwards, you need to copy the newly built `zssServer` file to the `zlux/zlux-app-server/bin` directory, so that `nodeServer.sh` and `zssServer.sh` can invoke it when executed.
You should also set the p attribute on it.
```
cp zssServer ../../zlux-app-server/bin
extattr +p ../../zlux-app-server/bin/zssServer
```
Finally, the ZSS cross memory server must be installed and configured according to [This Install Guide](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/blob/master/docs/user-guide/install-zos.md#manually-installing-the-zowe-cross-memory-server)


### 6. Run the server
At this point, all server files have been configured and Apps built, so ZSS and the App server are ready to run.
First, from the z/OS system, start ZSS.
```
cd ../zlux-app-server/bin
./zssServer.sh
```
This should start the zssServer. If the server did not start, two common sources of error are:

1. The *zssPort* chosen is already occupied. To fix, edit `config/zluxserver.json` to choose a new one, and re-run `build/deploy.sh` to have that change take effect.
2. The zssServer binary does not have the APF bit set. Since this server is meant for secure services, it is required. To fix, execute `extattr +a zssServer`.  Note you may need to alter the execute permissions of zssServer.sh in the event that the previous command is not satisfactory (eg `chmod +x zssServer.sh`) 

Second, from the system with the zLUX App Server, start it with a few parameters to hook it to ZSS.
```
cd ../zlux-app-server/bin

// Windows:
nodeServer.bat <parameters>

// Others:
./nodeServer.sh <parameters>
```
Valid parameters for nodeServer are as follows:
- *-h*: Specifies the hostname where ZSS can be found. Use as *-h \<hostname\>*
- *-P*: Specifies the port where ZSS can be found. Use as *-P \<port\>*. This overrides *zssPort* from the configuration file.
- *-p*: Specifies the HTTP port to be used by the zLUX App Server. Use as *-p <port>*. This overrides *node.http.port* from the configuration file.
- *-s*: Specifies the HTTPS port to be used by the zLUX App Server. Use as *-s <port>*. This overrides *node.https.port* from the configuration file.
- *--noChild*: If specified, tells the server to ignore and skip spawning of child processes defined as *node.childProcesses* in the configuration file.

In the example where we're running ZSS on a host named mainframe.zowe.com, running on zssPort = 19997, the App server running on Windows could be started with the following:

`nodeServer.bat -h mainframe.zowe.com -P 19997 -s 19998`

After which we'd be able to connect to the App server at HTTPS port 19998.

**NOTE: the parameter parsing is provided by [argumentParser.js](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-server-framework/blob/master/lib/argumentParser.js), which allows for a few variations of input, depending on preference. For example, the following are all valid ways to specify the ZSS host**

- **-h myhost.com**
- **-h=myhost.com**
- **--hostServer myhost.com**
- **--hostServer=myhost.com**

When the zLUX App Server has started, one of the last messages you will see as bootstrapping completes is that the server is listening on the HTTP/s port. At this time, you should be able to use the server.

### 7. Connect to the Zowe Desktop via a browser
Now that ZSS & the zLUX App Server are both started, you can access this instance by pointing your web browser to the zLUX App Server.
In this example, the address you will want to go to first is the location of the window management App - the Zowe Desktop.
The URL for this is:

`http(s)://<zLUX App Server>:<node.http(s).port>`

Which just points to: 

`http(s)://<zLUX App Server>:<node.http(s).port>/ZLUX/plugins/org.zowe.zlux.bootstrap/web/index.html`

Most likely for you, `zLUX App Server` will be `localhost`. `node.http(s).port` is the `-s` or `-p` port from the commands above. 

Here you should be greeted with a login screen and after loggin in, a desktop with a bottom menubar and apps (if you downloaded and installed them). If you set up ZSS as an authentication backend, you can login with your mainframe 
credentials. By default, trivial authentication is used which allows to login with arbitrary credentials. If you are unable to log in, make sure your ZSS authentication is probably set up by reviewing the [Server Configuration](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/Auth-Plugin-Configuration#server-configuration) for ZSS implementation.

### Try some apps

There are a few Apps you can try to see how they interact with the Zowe framework:

- [Zowe Editor](https://github.com/zowe/zlux-editor): This App can be used to navigate USS files & directories along with Datasets, given the proper authentication is set up. Current features including viewing Dataset contents & properties, writing/deleting files & directories, saving new files/folders and more. Continous development will lead to more support and community support is always encouraged.

- [TN3270](https://github.com/zowe/tn3270-ng2): This App communicates with the zLUX App Server to enable a TN3270 connection in the browser.

- [Sample Angular App](https://github.com/zowe/sample-angular-app): A simple App showing how a zLUX App frontend (this one uses Angular) component can communicate with an App backend (REST) component.

- [Sample React App](https://github.com/zowe/sample-react-app): Similar to the Angular App, but using React instead to show how you have the flexibility to use a framework of your choice.

- [Sample Iframe App](https://github.com/zowe/sample-iframe-app): Similar as the previous apps, but presented via usage of an IFrame and an Iframe adapter script that allows for the same Zowe framework features shared by Angular and React.

This concludes the zLUX App Server setup for first-time users.

## App configuration
This section does not cover any dynamic runtime inclusion of Apps, but rather Apps defined in advance.
In the configuration file, a directory can be specified which contains JSON files which tell the server what App is to be included and where to find it on disk. The backend of these Apps use the Server's Plugin structure, so much of the server-side references to Apps use the term Plugin.

To include Apps, be sure to define the location of the Plugins directory in the configuration file, via the top-level attribute *pluginsDir*

**NOTE: In this repository, the directory for these JSON files is `/plugins`. Yet, in order to seperate configuration files from runtime files, the zlux-app-server repository copies the contents of this folder into `/deploy/instance/ZLUX/plugins`. So, the example configuration file uses the latter directory.**


#### Deploy example
```
// All paths relative to zlux-app-server/js or zlux-app-server/bin
// In real installations, these values will be configured during the install.
  "rootDir":"../deploy",
  "productDir":"../deploy/product",
  "siteDir":"../deploy/site",
  "instanceDir":"../deploy/instance",
  "groupsDir":"../deploy/instance/groups",
  "usersDir":"../deploy/instance/users"

```

#### Plugins directory example
```
// All paths relative to zlux-app-server/js or zlux-app-server/bin
// In real installations, these values will be configured during the install.
//...
  "pluginsDir":"../deploy/instance/ZLUX/plugins",
```

### ZSS Configuration
When running ZSS, it will require a JSON configuration file similar or the same as the one used for the zLUX server. The attributes that are needed for ZSS, at minimum, are:*rootDir*, *productDir*, *siteDir*, *instanceDir*, *groupsDir*, *usersDir*, *pluginsDir* and **agent.http.port**. All of these attributes have the same meaning as described above for the zLUX server, but if the zLUX server and ZSS are not run from the same location, then these directories may be different if desired.

The one attribute that is specific to ZSS however is **agent.http.port**. This is the TCP port which ZSS will listen on to be contacted by the zLUX server. Define this in the configuration file as a value between 1024-65535. See [zss configuration](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/wiki/Configuration-for-ZLUX-App-Server-&-ZSS#zss-configuration) for more information and an example.

#### Connecting zLUX server to ZSS
When running the zLUX server, simply specify a few flags to declare which ZSS instance zLUX will proxy ZSS requests to:
- *-h*: Declares the host where ZSS can be found. Use as "-h \<hostname\>"
- *-P*: Declares the port at which ZSS is listening. Use as "-P \<port\>"
